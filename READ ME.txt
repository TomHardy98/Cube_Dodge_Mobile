To play my game you either need to install the CubeDodge.apk onto an Android device
or run it in Unity. If you run the game in Unity you will find that you have no player
controls because its all set up for a mobile device. You can run the game and have it all
work fine, but the player wont be able to move as there is no PC input. The build is also
not built in android.

The Instructions:

The object of the game is to survive for as long as possible against falling blocks that
over time fall more frequently and fall faster. All highscores are saved on the device their
played on. To move left you tilt your device left in landscape and to move right you tilt
your device right in landscape.

The main menu can be used in landscape or portrait and it will scale all the UI accordingly.

Enjoy the game! :)
